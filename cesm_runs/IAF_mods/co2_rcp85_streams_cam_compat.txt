      This is a streams file to pass historical CO2 from datm8 to the other
      surface models. It reads in a historical dataset derived from data used
      by CAM. The getco2_historical.ncl script in models/lnd/clm2/tools/ncl_scripts
      was used to convert the CAM file to a streams compatible format (adding domain
      information and making CO2 have latitude/longitude even if only for a single 
      point.

        Input stream description file for historical CO2 reconstruction data

        06 May 2015: Modified by K Lindsay for new dataset w/ time and date
        compatiable with CAM's usage.
        22 May 2013: Modified by K Lindsay for new dataset location.
        11 Jan 2011: Modified by K Lindsay to use different file with longer record.
        04 March 2010: Converted to form that can be used by datm8 by Erik Kluzek
        18 December 2009: Prepared by B. Eaton using data provided by 
        Jean-Francois Lamarque. All variables except f11 are directly from
        PRE2005_MIDYR_CONC.DAT. Data from 1765 to 2007 with 2006/2007 just
        a repeat of 2005.
